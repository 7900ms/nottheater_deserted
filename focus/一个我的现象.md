a extremely personal experience

i usually try not focus on meaning only. i like to hear diff ppl with intersting meanings and I think listening to their meaning is what really draws my attention. and for my expressing myself, i try not to think about the expressions, cuz think about it is worry about it. i think for me to improvise is fine. cuz when i emphasis on expressions i can say really little, and when i think about the meaning, i usually say a lot. If i want to be fluent effect, to think only about the meaning (not meaning+expression, not expressions), that works for me. That is a extremely personal experience.
