a extremely personal experience

i usually try not focus on meaning only. i like to hear diff ppl with intersting meanings and I think listening to their meaning is what really draws my attention. and for my expressing myself, i try not to think about the expressions, cuz think about it is worry about it. i think for me to improvise is fine. cuz when i emphasis on expressions i can say really little, and when i think about the meaning, i usually say a lot. If i want to be fluent effect, to think only about the meaning (not meaning+expression, not expressions), that works for me. That is a extremely personal experience. 

thinking about the meaning would make me say a lot, and saying a lot makes me think more about the meaning. This is a mutual promotion, enhancing each other. for a extremely personal experience, i think this stimulus works, and i will go with it.

It is especially when i tried to think about the right way to speak like searching in my brain for the right words to say, with time limited, I got frustrated and thought, "damn it, it is better to say something than not saying anything." Then i just start improvise, with full mind stopping from searching and struggling for words. Get the meaning out, that's it.
